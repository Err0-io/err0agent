== Building

Make sure you're running err0server and that it is working...

Make sure that `open-source-bundle` is checked out in the same parent directory as err0agent (e.g. it is ../open-source-bundle ...)

== Run the test cases

```
err0proto $ ./gradlew clean runShadow
```

See what's to run in `build.gradle.kts` - the arguments are at the end of the build.gradle.kts file.
